# Lua Bridge

A cross platform Lua wrapper for Golang with some nice abstractions.

The drive behind making this project is for use in another project that is reimagining the web using a custom
Lua runtime. This project allows for Golang code to hack the vanilla Lua runtime to add, remove, and modify code
before it is even seen by the lua compiler. One such example of where this is useful is in the ability to
patch Lua's `require()` function as seen in [main.go from commit: 8267d7b](https://github.com/Breadleaf/LuaBridge/blob/8267d7b993601c5d467c6393391a7aefe1396c6c/main.go) to both limit it to not import the os module but also extend it to look
at user defined global modules. This could be further extended to make requests to servers similar to the inner workings
of a browser when you import something in javascript which triggers a `HTTP GET` for that file.

# Build

Assuming [Brent Farris' README](https://github.com/BrentFarris/Cgo-Lua/blob/master/README.md) to be correct.
I modified the `./lua/wrapper.go` to include the `LDFLAGS` and it built fine on my mac system running:
`Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0 -- arm64`. If the build is working for Brent, I am going to consider this covering
all platforms âˆˆ {MacOS, Windows, Linux} (and maybe any POSIX system) as true until proven otherwise.

You will need to ensure you have gcc on your system since this package uses [CGo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo).

If you want to contribute, I also am assuming that you have wget, make, zip installed and in your path.

# Managing Lua

If there is a change in lua dependency for the project, the make file will change. Run `make` to install the
changes and patch the install. If you are using this project through `go get` you will not need to worry
about this as each new dependency or change will be a tag in the github repo for you to update to with `go get -u`

# Credit where credit it due

I am using the Lua official codebase. I do not own the code, I am simply using,
patching, and writting a wrapper around it to ensure that you can interop with lua without all the
hassle I went through :)

Lua us under the MIT licence. See it's licence [here](https://www.lua.org/license.html).

My jumping off point for this project was the [BrentFarris/Cgo-Lua](https://github.com/BrentFarris/Cgo-Lua)
project. It is also under the MIT licence and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/BrentFarris/Cgo-Lua/blob/master/LICENSE).

Inspiration and some points of research from [martin/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3).

## Disclaimer

A lot of my code will be similar to Brent Farris' code as we have similar projects.
My project will likely implement a few more features over Brent's code and a few less.
